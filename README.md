**<h2>Introduction</h2>**

<h3>Greetings!</h3>

<p>I'm Rakan Al-Madani, I'm 25 years old and I've studied Software Engineering in Zarqa Private University and gradutaed in 2020. <br>
I have 0 expirence in the field of software engineering as I've worked in other fields such as CSR and content security moderation.</p><br>


**<h2>What I learned</h2>**

<p> Coding is not simple the act of learning how to write a program in a specific language and then releasing. <br><br>

It's much more than that, you should use ethics here as well as your daily life, You need to get to know what are you creating and for who, How to make simply and as efficent as possible & also we must create a program that we will be able to improvve and fix instead of building what so ever without planning ahead how to deal with it later.</p>
